[Bookshop.org Shakespeare link](https://bookshop.org/contributors/william-shakespeare-c7022f36-d654-40b7-b57d-7d7bf196efc9)- You can select an awesome independent bookstore you want to support, adn buying through this link makes that happen!


[Arden Shakespeare](https://www.bloomsbury.com/academic/academic-subjects/drama-and-performance-studies/plays-shakespeare/): Recommended version, although what's **really** recommended is to not get into the weeds about version nuances, and just getting one play and reading it. Pick one and see how you like it- If you were underwhelmed by that publisher's version, then buy a different version for the next play we read. Versions include Arden, Oxford, Folger, Penguin's Pelican, Norton. New Cambridge, David Bevington, and the Riverside Shakespeare (now the Wadsworth Shakespeare). The Arden plays are thick but they do give you a rainbow-coloured bookshelf.


[Penguin's Pelican individual plays](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/BS5/the-pelican-shakespeare) are some of the easiest to carry around- much more likely to read a book you have, than a tome in a stack sometimes. 


[Project Gutenberg Shakespeare free downloads:](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/65) Absolute classic.


[The Folger Shakespeare Library free downloads:](https://shakespeare.folger.edu/download/) PDF, DOC (for Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, Apache Open Office, etc.), HTML, TXT, XML, and TEI Simple (also have an API).
