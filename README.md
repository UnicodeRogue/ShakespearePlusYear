# ShakespearePlusYear
A plan to read all of Shakespeare plus more playwrights

I've seen a fair number of "Read all of Shakespeare in a year" posts- I added the **Plus** for two reasons:

1. You don't have to set the parameters to one year- you can still work through the complete works, on your own pace. I'm doing one a month. 
2. There's more to plays than Shakespeare. I'm also reading one play by another playwright a month and it's been a great combo

The sequence I'm using was created by Benjamin McEvoy and his post is in the source link I'm including here ⤵️

I'm adding a smoother way to parse the data, other data fields like year and genre, and other cool things that I find and make. 

Years are approximate. There's a considerable amount of scholarly work about this; a number of plays continued to be worked on and changed over the years as they were in production during Shakespeare's time. You'll frequently see the Play+ThisYear data range a bit in various books and sites, depending on whether the year is considered "First year of known performance," "First year Shakespeare may have started writing it," or a number of other factors. Years in my dataset are based on the earliest year listed in the approximate date attribution range for each play from the Enclycopedia Britannica:
