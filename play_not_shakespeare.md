Either someone writing during Shakespeare's lifetime (approx 1564-1616) anywhere in the world, 

someone writing plays now, a mid-this-century writer ( [Pulitizer prize winners](https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-category/218), perhaps?),

someone writing [plays where you live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_playwrights_by_nationality_and_year_of_birth), someone writing plays in [a country you want to visit](https://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-playwrights-2030379)- there are so many voices and stories to enjoy.
